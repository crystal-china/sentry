# Breaking Changes

1. --build-command=COMMAND need specify the build command without args, e.g. crystal
    In the configuration file, the corresponding `build`  has been changed to `build_command`
2. --build-args=ARGS need specify build string but without the command part, e.g. `build src/sentry_cli.cr -o bin/sentry`
   In the configuration file, the corresponding `build`  has been changed to `build_args`
3. the `-b` is still keep for backwards compatibility, but without the long-command form.

# New feature

1. Many bugs get fixed.
2. sentry will play a audio file when build success/fail, individually. (Linux only)
3. now, configuration file support settings all options, except `--src`, latter tend to use in command line only,
   instead of setting `--build-command` and `--build-args` or `-b` when there is no `shard.yml` exists.

# Sentry ðŸ¤–

Build/Runs your crystal application, watches files, and rebuilds/reruns app on file changes

## Installation

To install in your project, from the root directory of your project, run:

To use sentry, download released binary from [release page](https://github.com/crystal-china/sentry/releases), then copy it into
a folder in the $PATH, run it!

### Options

You don't need to set any options if you're using the `shards` to manage build.

```bash
 â•°â”€â”€âž¤ $ sentry
ðŸ¤–  Your SentryBot is vigilant. beep-boop...
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/daka/version.cr
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/daka.cr
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/records.ecr
ðŸ¤–  compiling daka...
ðŸ¤–  starting daka...
[development] Kemal is ready to lead at http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

If you are don't use shards, specify the entry path for the main crystal file use --src should enough.

```bash
sentry --src=src/sentry.cr
```

For the detailed usage, please check following command-line help or check [.sentry.example.yml](./.sentry.example.yml) 

```bash
 Usage: ./sentry [options]
    -n NAME, --name=NAME             Sets the display name of the app process (default: sentry)
    --src=PATH                       Sets the entry path for the main crystal file inferred from shard.yml (default: src/sentry_cli.cr)
    --build-command=COMMAND          Overrides the default build command (default: crystal)
    --build-args=ARGS                Specifies arguments for the build command (default: build src/sentry_cli.cr -o ./bin/sentry)
    -b FULL_COMMAND                  Set both `BUILD COMMAND' and `BUILD ARGS', for backwards compatibility (default: crystal build src/sentry_cli.cr -o ./bin/sentry)
    --no-build                       Skips the build step
    -r COMMAND, --run=COMMAND        Overrides the default run command inferred from shard.yml (default: ./bin/sentry)
    --run-args=ARGS                  Specifies arguments for the run command, (default: '')
    -w FILE, --watch=FILE            Appends to list of watched files, (will overrides default: ["./src/**/*.cr", "./src/**/*.ecr"])
    -c FILE, --config=FILE           Specifies a file to load for automatic configuration (default: .sentry.yml)
    --install                        Run `shards install' once before running Sentry build and run commands
    --no-color                       Removes colorization from output
    --not-play-audio                 Skips the attempt to play audio file with `aplay' from `alsa-utils' package when building on Linux succeeds or fails
    -i, --info                       Shows the configuration informations
    -V, --version                    Shows version
    -h, --help                       Show this help
```

#### Override Default Files to Watch

```bash
./sentry -w "./src/**/*.cr" -w "./lib/**/*.cr"
```

By specifying files to watch, the default will be omitted. So if you want to watch all of the file in your `src` directory, you will need to specify that like in the above example.

#### Show Info Before Running

This shows the values for the build command, run command, and watched files.

```bash
ðŸ¤–  Sentry configuration:
      display name:           sentry
      shard name:             sentry
      src_path:               src/sentry_cli.cr
      build_command:          crystal
      build_args:             build src/sentry_cli.cr -o ./bin/sentry
      run_command:            ./bin/sentry
      run_args:
      watched files:          ["./src/**/*.cr", "./src/**/*.ecr"]
      colorize:               true
      run shards install:     false
      should play audio:      true
      should build:           true
      should print info:      true
ðŸ¤–  Your SentryBot is vigilant. beep-boop...
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/sentry/process_runner.cr
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/sentry/config.cr
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/sentry/sound_file_storage.cr
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/sentry.cr
ðŸ¤–  watching file: ./src/sentry_cli.cr
ðŸ¤–  compiling sentry...
ðŸ¤–  starting sentry...
```

#### Setting Build or Run Arguments

If you prefer granularity, you can specify arguments to the build or run commands using the `--build-args` or `--run-args` flags followed by a string of arguments.

```bash
./sentry -r "crystal" --run-args "spec --debug"
```

#### Running `shards install` Before Starting

This is especially usefull when initiating Sentry from a `Dockerfile` or `package.json` file. It guarantees all the shards are installed before running.

```bash
./sentry --install
```

#### Reading Configurations from a File

Sentry will automatically read configurations from `.sentry.yml` if it exists. This can be changed with `-c FILE` or `--config=FILE`.

See definition in [.sentry.example.yml](./.sentry.example.yml) for valid file properties.

#### Removing Colorization

Sentry output is colorized by default. To remove colorization, pass the `--no-color` argument.

Example

```bash
./sentry --no-color
```

## Sentry Crystal API

See [CRYSTAL_API.md](./CRYSTAL_API.md)

## Why?

(1) It is tiring to have to stop and restart an app on every change.

(2) Docker!

Stop and restarting your app is especially expensive (and annoying) when running the app in a docker container, where one would need to totally rebuild the docker image for every change.

Now, for development, simply run sentry in your docker container, and it will rebuild the app from the docker container on any changes, without rebuilding the docker image/container.
